Predicting How Many Customers Churn at IBM

# PROJECT OBJECTIVE
This project takes a customer churn dataset on IBMS customers and uses classification machine learning algothrims to predict how many customer churn. There is 
a single y target variable "churn" (I am predicting one column attribute in the dataset churn.) 

# PROJECT VALUE
The results of the machine learning models and analysis of all relevant customer data can develop focused customer retention programs for IBM.
